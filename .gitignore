# Specific to Stow (if applicable) #
###############################
# If you're using Stow, you might want to exclude
# the symlinks from being tracked directly (although
# tracking the Stow directory itself is fine).  This
# depends on your workflow.  If you *want* to track
# the symlinks, remove these lines.
# * ->        #This can cause issues, see below.
# If you have individual "package" directories that contain symlinks, you can specify them:
# bash ->  #Example of "package" directory with symlinks
# vim -> #Example of "package" directory with symlinks

# If your stow directory is in a subdirectory, you need to specify the paths to ignore
#Example, if your stow directory is in a .config directory
# .config/bash ->
# .config/vim ->

# Custom additions #
##################
# Add any other patterns specific to your setup here.
# For example, if you have a specific file you want to ignore:
# my_special_file.txt
